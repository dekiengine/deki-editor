# Changelog

Notable changes to the Deki Editor. Format-affecting and behaviour-affecting
changes are listed with what a project has to do, if anything. Engine changes
are in [deki-engine/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/dekiengine/deki-engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Unreleased

## 0.15.0 - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Stripping. A device or simulator build leaves out what the project does
  not use. A package's features already name the component types they
  provide; the editor scans the project's scenes and sources for those names,
  and a feature none of them mentions stays out of the build: its sources out
  of the package glob, its header out of the reflection codegen, its define
  unset. Two switches in the Build panel: strip unused components (on by
  default) and strip unused packages (off; a package none of whose components
  any scene or source names, and that nothing kept requires). The Package
  Manager's
  details view shows every feature's fate with a reason, and lets a feature
  be pinned on, for a component a script creates in a way the scan cannot
  see, or forced off. A feature marked `required` in its descriptor is never
  offered. The scan reads the platforms' boot scenes as well as the project's,
  so a platform's setup components count as used. Settings live in
  `settings/build.json`. The build log says what was stripped, and
  `--strip-plan <project>` prints every decision with its reason. The
  editor's own builds never strip.
- A feature that includes another's header keeps it: the resolver reads the
  package's sources, so roller keeps clip without the descriptor saying so.
- Firmware: when something is stripped, the firmware build regenerates the
  reflection tables itself with the same exclusions, since the copies the
  editor leaves in each package were made with every feature present. That
  path needs GCC 16 on the building machine and says so if it is missing.
  When nothing is stripped, firmware builds are exactly what they were.
- `ResolveTransformWidth` also honours a required feature whose define is
  `DEKI_TRANSFORM_2D` or `DEKI_TRANSFORM_3D`, so a package may declare the
  transform in its features list instead of a tag.
